# Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

A full-fledged machine learning project to detect heart disease based on patient health metrics. This project uses classical machine learning models optimized with advanced techniques to deliver high accuracy, precision, and robustness. It includes a GUI application for easy predictions using trained models.

## ü©∫ Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection through predictive modeling can save lives. This project uses medical datasets and several machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease.
